                <h2>About Sean Allen Bostic</h2>
                <p>I was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio. I became fascinated with computers at an early start once my father brought home a Hewlett Packard desktop. I was fascinated by things as simple as the file storage and the Internet.</p>
                <p>What I loved most about my family's computer was the fact that I could play games on it. I remember forgetting to eat because I was so in awe of the virtual world in front of my eyes. Everything changed once I understood what the Internet was.</p>
                <p>The fact that I could play someone in a game across the world blew my mind. The rest is history, I loved computing in every way and saw how powerful it was. I then began building my own custom PC's out of salvaged parts and eventually out of new parts.</p>

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>I have quite a few hobbies if I am honest. Any chance I can get to travel, I will take it. I actually flew cross country with my best friend from Cleveland, Ohio to Los Angeles, California when I was 19. It was a very enjoyable trip and one that I will never forget. </p>
                <p>Outside of travel, my biggest hobby is Powerlifting. Powerlifting is a form of competitive weightlifting in which contestants attempt three types of lift in a sequence. I currently wegih in at 165 lbs and my pr totals are Squat: 335 lbs, Bench: 265 lbs, Deadlift: 455 lbs</p>
                <p>I also really enjoy watching films. I love seeing new movies and love re-watching the classics. My favorite movie of all time is Forrest Gump.</p>

                <h2>PC Gaming</h2>
                <p>Unfortunately, I hardly play any video games anymor. However, I have always had a love for video games. I really enjoy the FPS (First Person Shooter) genre and started when I was extremely young. I first started playing Quake, Unreal Tournament, and early Counterstrike 1.6. </p>
                <p>There is so much in classic FPS games that people overlook and just assume it is like every other video game. They seem to ignore the skill required to be good, strategic planning, and exploits.</p>
                <p>I have played the Call of Duty series since the beginning (before it got bad) and have won money in tournaments online/LAN. I attribute my interest in computing to video games since I literally had to build my own to play the newest games. </p>

                <h2>Weightlifting and Fitness</h2>
                <p>I have a huge passion for fitness, in particular weightlifting, and even more in particular powerlifting. I consider myself deceivingly strong and I am often overlooked when it comes to sports because of my size. </p>
                <p>I am interested in powerlifting which is the Big 3 - squat, bench, and deadlift. I am planning on competing in the near future at the 165 lb (77 kg) weightclass. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Squat: 335 lbs</li>
                  <li>Bench: 235 lbs</li>
                  <li>Deadlift: 415 lbs</li>
